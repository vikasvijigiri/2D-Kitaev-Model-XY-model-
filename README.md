# 2D-Kitaev-Model (XY-model)

Ways to install:
#-----------------

1) Just run test_prepare.py inside the build directory. 
   * This will create subdirectories with each parameter values inscribed in the directory. E.g. J_H_0.0 would imply The J_H cou;ling with value 0.0.
   

2) In the analysis part there are the preprocessing files in Python for processing the data obtained from QMC.
